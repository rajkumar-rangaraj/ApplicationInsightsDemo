# Application Insights Auto-Instrumentation Architecture
## Technical Architecture for Patent Application

### Abstract

This document describes a novel system architecture for automatic instrumentation of software applications without requiring code modifications. The system provides a method for injecting monitoring capabilities into running .NET Core applications through a non-invasive process that leverages runtime hooks and dynamic assembly loading techniques. The architecture addresses several key challenges in application monitoring, including compatibility across different versions of the .NET Core framework, isolation from application code, and configuration without application modification.

### Background

Traditional application monitoring solutions require developers to explicitly add instrumentation code to their applications, resulting in increased development effort, potential for errors, and complications in the deployment process. This invention provides a technical solution to these challenges by enabling automatic instrumentation through a novel runtime attachment mechanism that requires no code changes and minimal configuration.

### Technical Problem Addressed

The invention addresses several technical problems in the field of application monitoring:

1. **Non-invasive Monitoring**: Enabling comprehensive application monitoring without modifying application source code or requiring recompilation
2. **Cross-framework Compatibility**: Supporting diverse .NET Core framework versions with a unified monitoring infrastructure
3. **Runtime Attachment**: Establishing monitoring capabilities at runtime before application code executes
4. **Assembly Isolation**: Preventing conflicts between monitoring components and application dependencies
5. **Dynamic Configuration**: Supporting monitoring configuration without application changes

### Architecture Overview

The system employs a multi-layered architecture with specialized components that interact with the .NET Core runtime environment to establish monitoring capabilities before application code executes. The architecture is optimized for the .NET Core runtime environment.

The auto-instrumentation architecture consists of several layers that work together to enable monitoring without application code changes:

1. **Startup Hook Layer**
   - Acts as the entry point into the application process
   - Executes before any application code runs
   - Establishes the foundation for the instrumentation system
   - Configures the runtime to redirect assembly loading as needed

2. **Bootstrapper Layer**
   - Performs compatibility detection with the application
   - Handles intelligent "back-off" when manual instrumentation is detected
   - Manages the lifecycle of telemetry components
   - Bridges the startup hook and the telemetry system

3. **Telemetry System**
   - Collects performance data and exceptions across the application
   - Monitors HTTP requests, database calls, and external dependencies
   - Tracks application metrics and custom events
   - Ensures proper correlation between related telemetry items

4. **Configuration System**
   - Processes environment variables and configuration files
   - Applies default settings and overrides for different environments
   - Supports dynamic mapping rules to customize monitoring behavior
   - Enables zero-code configuration for diverse deployment scenarios

The key innovation in this architecture is how these components collaborate with the .NET Core runtime and application without requiring code changes:

```

This architecture enables comprehensive application monitoring with these key characteristics:

- **Zero-Code Integration**: Application code remains completely unchanged
- **Early Attachment**: Monitoring begins before the first line of application code executes
- **Complete Coverage**: Captures all aspects of application behavior including startup
- **Isolation**: Monitoring components don't interfere with application dependencies
- **Adaptability**: Automatically adjusts to different .NET Core versions and environments

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Runtime Attachment Mechanism

The system employs the .NET Core Runtime Startup Hook mechanism for runtime attachment:

- Utilizes the .NET Runtime Startup Hook mechanism
- Entry point is established before application code execution
- Environment variable `DOTNET_STARTUP_HOOKS` points to the runtime hook assembly
- Special ASP.NET Core integration via `ASPNETCORE_HOSTINGSTARTUPASSEMBLIES` for web applications

#### Dynamic Assembly Loading and Resolution

A key technical aspect of the invention is its assembly loading and resolution strategy:

1. **Custom Assembly Resolution**:

   - Routes specific assembly requests to monitoring components
   - Maintains isolation from application assemblies

2. **Version Compatibility Detection**:
   - Analyzes the runtime environment to determine compatible monitoring components
   - Selects appropriate implementation based on detected versions
   - Adapts monitoring behavior to the runtime environment

3. **Assembly Isolation Strategy**:
   - Prevents monitoring assemblies from interfering with application assemblies
   - Uses specialized packaging to avoid dependency conflicts
   - Maintains separate loading paths for monitoring components

#### Multi-Phase Initialization Process

The system employs a multi-phase initialization process to ensure proper monitoring establishment:

2. **Dependency Monitoring**:
   - Tracks outbound calls to external services
   - Monitors database operations and external APIs
   - Correlates dependency calls with originating requests

3. **Exception Monitoring**:
   - Captures unhandled exceptions throughout the application
   - Records exception details, stack traces, and context
   - Associates exceptions with related telemetry

4. **Custom Metric Collection**:
   - Establishes channels for application performance metrics
   - Monitors CPU, memory, and resource utilization
   - Tracks application-specific performance indicators

#### Configuration Without Application Changes

The system provides multiple mechanisms for configuration without requiring application changes:

1. **Environment Variable Configuration**:
   - Uses predefined environment variables to control monitoring behavior
   - Supports connection strings, authentication settings, and feature flags
   - Enables deployment-time configuration changes

2. **Dynamic Mapping Configuration**:
   - Supports mapping different monitoring destinations based on application characteristics
